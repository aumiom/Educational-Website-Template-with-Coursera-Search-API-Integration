The above project is a Python/Django website that mocks Coursera.org. The layout is different than Coursera and contains few more functional elements than Coursera. It has a search bar in which various courses in Coursera can be searched. I have used Coursera API for this. As of now I have limited the search results to few. This can be changed by editing the views.py file. 

You can see the demo on aumiom.pythonanywhere.com/myapp
